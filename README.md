The website project 'lumiere' is a mock-up portfolio that showcases personal app projects to catch the eye of a potential employer. This portfolio itself should demonstrate necessary html and css skills as a web developer. The complete page can be accessed [here](https://kcsheng.github.io/lumiere/).

### User story <br>

An employer is looking for a potential candidate for an open position. The employer wants to view a portfolio website that includes the candidate's work samples.

### Acceptance criteria

- The portfolio should present the developer's name, photo and a navigation bar that allows me (as an employer) to peruse their professional profile, work, resume and contact information on the same page.

- Each navigation link should take me to the corresponding section.

- Particularly, when the 'work' link is clicked, an app collection should be presented with titles and associated images.

- When the mouse pointer hovers over the app (title or image), the image should be enlarged and brightened, much more noticeable than other app containers.

- When I click on the app(title or image), I am taken to the deployed app or its codebase.

- The site should have a reponsive layout, responding fluently to different viewports.

### Wireframe

At the beginning of the project, the wireframe was drawn to serve as the backbone of the site:<br>

### Color palette

In terms of the feel of presentation, I choose the following color scheme:<br>

### Test

The wave test suggests no errors associated with accessibility. The alerts pertain to the embedded links which are designed according to the requirement. <br>

### Notes

To display the text neatly, the descriptions of work experience and education are presented in a stacked format, rather than two columns side by side as suggested by the initial wireframe.

Additionally, an avatar, which is not shown in wireframe, has also been added to the page.

This web page is fully responsive. With a desktop-first approach, the media query is written to fit the page in the smallest screen device, such as iphone 5.
